This development article walks you through creating an AEM 6.3 project by using Archetype 11 and explains the default AEM files and services. Using an Archetype 11 project, you are given a set of files to start with:

* 2 Pages: English and French pages with filler text

* 2 Templates: 
** For homepage and content pages
** Homepages are only allowed on top level, and content pages below

* Page component

** Allow direct drag & drop of assets from the content finder into parsys (6.1 TouchUI)
** Dictionnary structure for internationalizing hardcoded strings

* Client libraries
** Responsive layout with colctr that break for narrow pages
** CSS class names follow AEM naming conventions
** Component-specific styles stored within each component
** Master ClientLib under /etc/designs merges all client libraries into one file

** Servlets: Rendering the output of specific requests
** Filters: Applied to the requests before dispatching to the servlet or script
